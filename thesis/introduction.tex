\section{Background and Motivation}

The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem asks for a satisfying
assignment for a given Boolean formula or determine that no such
assignment exists and the formula is inconsistent.  SAT has
applications in Computer Aided Design, planning, routing,
software testing, synthesis, theorem proving and computational
biology \cite{Smith_diagnosis, Soeken:2010:VUM:1870926.1871248,
demoura2008z3, Corblin07asat-based, Kautz:1992:PS:145448.146725}.

For example, an interesting problem is coloring vertices
of an undirected graph with at most $k$ colors such that no
two adjacent vertices have the same color (e.g. see Figure
\ref{fig:color-graph}). Coloring with three colors is expressed as
a SAT problem as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For every vertex, for each color assign one Boolean variable: $u, v, t$
  \item Each vertex has at least one color: $(u \lor v \lor t)$.
  \item Each vertex cannot use two colors:
  $(\neg u \lor v) \land (\neg u \lor t)$ etc.
  \item Two adjacent vertices, $A$ and $B$, must have different colors:
  $(\neg u_A \lor \neg u_B) \land (\neg v_B \lor \neg v_B) \land (\neg t_B \lor \neg t_B)$.
\end{itemize}

A Boolean formula is in conjunctive normal form (or CNF) if it is
a conjunction of clauses. A clause is a disjunction of literals. A
literal is a variable, or the negation of a variable. $k$-SAT is
the problem of finding a satisfying assignment for a CNF formula
where all clauses have at most $k$ literals.  The example above
was expressed in the CNF.

SAT is the first and one of the simplest NP-complete problem
\cite{Cook:1971:CTP:800157.805047}. It is known that $2$-SAT
is in P \cite{karp}, while for $k \ge 3$ only exponential time
algorithms are known, such as Sch\"{o}ning's algorithm which runs in
$O((2\frac{k - 1}{k})^n \cdot poly(n))$ where $n$ is the number of
variables \cite{Schoning:1999:PAK:795665.796524}.  Many problems,
such as "independent set problem", are proven to be NP-complete
by encoding SAT into that problem in polynomial time.  There have
been many failed attempts to find polynomial time algorithms for
$k$-SAT in order to prove that P=NP.  \footnote{The following
site lists many attempts at providing a polynomial solution to
SAT. \url{http://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm}}

Although some industrial problems can be quite large (on the order
of tens of thousands of variables), some applications, such
as \emph{Automatic Test Pattern Generation}, are very easy to
solve in practice (ATPG has a running time of $O(n^3)$) because they
exhibit hidden structures easily exploitable by current SAT solvers
\cite{Prasad:1999:WAE:309847.309857}.

While state of the art sequential solvers are fast, there have
been no recent algorithmic improvements which have provided major
speed-ups. On the other hand, new applications challenge modern SAT
solvers with more complex problems.  The lack of performance increase
is accentuated by the recent architecture shift from uni-core to
multi-cores systems. This is caused by the thermal wall: increasing
frequency leads to higher power consumption and more generated
heat. While Moore's law continues, processor manufactures use the
extra transistors to build multi-core chips (while individual cores
may become slower).  Therefore, SAT solvers need to adapt to this
new paradigm.

In this thesis we introduce STRUCTure, a distributed SAT solver
developed at VU University Amsterdam using Constellation, a
distributed computing framework. In STRUCTure there is an initiator
which starts the solving procedure, but except that the solving
is completely decentralized.  SAT solvers are made of two parts:
reasoning procedures and searching.  Our solver aims at parallelizing
the search and not the reasoning techniques.  This simplifies some
algorithms such as Pure Literal Rule (see \ref{ssec:pl}) which are
inherently sequential \cite{Johannsen:2005:CPL:1166822.1166834}.

\emph{Scaling-out} is the ability to do tasks faster when
more processing units are added to the distributed process
\cite{citeulike:1567858}. There are two main ways to scale
out:
\begin{inparaenum}[a)]
  \item increasing number of CPUs and/or cores per node; or
  \item adding multiple nodes to the distributed process.
\end{inparaenum} Each has different implications for the development
of a parallel and distributed SAT solver which will investigate in
Chapter \ref{chap:results}.


\section{Contributions}

This thesis brings several contributions to SAT solving. First
we implement a completely decentralized distributed search
algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm (see Section
\ref{ssec:searching-tree}).  Our solver is built on top of
Constellation which provides work balancing and seemingless
distributed computation.  Next, we show how clause learning can be
easily performed in a distributed environment by doing the learn
during searching, but using the learned clauses after search is
interrupted (see Section \ref{ssec:learning}).  Finally, a new
algorithm for Hyper-Unit and Hyper-Binary Resolutions (see Section
\ref{ssec:hbr}) is provided in appendix \ref{chap:algorithms}.


\section{Outline}

Chapter \ref{chap:related}, \emph{\nameref{chap:related}}, presents other
approaches to parallel and general sat solving. STRUCTure is compared
with other SAT solvers and the main differences are discussed.

Chapter \ref{chap:sat}, \emph{\nameref{chap:sat}}, formalizes the SAT
problem and explains common simplification and reasonings techniques.
Next, chapter \emph{\nameref{chap:architecture}} describes in detail
the design of STRUCTure. Constellation, a scalable distributed
programming framework, is also presented here.

In Chapter \ref{chap:results}, \emph{\nameref{chap:results}}, STRUCTure is
run with SAT instances from SAT Competition 2009. Simplification
procedures and reasoning techniques implemented in STRUCTure are
evaluated. Moreover, the scalability of STRUCTure is tested using
different combinations of number of nodes and number of cores
per node.

The following chapter, \ref{chap:future}, lists some ideas that can
improve STRUCTure's performance and make it competitive with respect
to the state of art solvers. Finally, in chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}
some conclusions are drawn.
