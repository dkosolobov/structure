\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to thank Kees Verstoep who offered me the chance to
work on a SAT solver back in 2009 on a paid position. He is also
the administrator of the DAS-4 cluster where I did most of tests
tests. To my surprise, he did not ban me every time I overloaded
the cluster.

Many thanks to my supervisors, Jason Maassen and Kees Verstoep, for
their guidance while working on STRUCTure. Our discussions were very
insightful and often turned into nice ideas. They provided me with
numerous reviews and comments on the margin of this paper.

I would also like to thank to Mate Soos, the author of Cryptominisat,
who, indirectly through his blog, thought me a lot about
SAT solving.

Finally, I owe a debt of gratitude to my friends and my parents
who supported me unconditionally and encouraged me while I worked
on my thesis.
