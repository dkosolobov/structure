\chapter{Experimental Results}

\section{Setup}

STRUCTure was evaluated on DAS-4 (\url{http://www.cs.vu.nl/das4/})
cluster at VU University Amsterdam (\url{http://www.few.vu.nl}). The
cluster is composed of 74 machines with dual quad core Intel E5620
processors running at 2.4GHz and 24GB of memory. This setup allows
evaluation of different types of parallelization:
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
  \item when more nodes are added and
  \item when more CPUs per node are added.
\end{inparaenum}

With hyper threading enabled each node has 16 logical
processors. Most tests don't use all node's processors and
Constellation will not spawn more than specified number of threads.
However Java Virtual Machine will use the additional computing
power for things like Parallel Garbage Collector.

STRUCTure was evaluated using problems from SAT Competition
2009 (\url{http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/}). These instances
are divided in three categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Formulas in \emph{application} category encode different
  problems and are typically very large (up to tens of millions
  of variables and clauses)
  \item \emph{Crafted} SAT instances are generally small and
  designed to stress solvers.
  \item \emph{Random} instances contain random $k$-SAT formulas.
\end{itemize}

Instances are also divided depending on their difficulty:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{easy} instances were solved by all solvers in
  the competition;
  \item \emph{medium} instances were solved by at least one solver; and
  \item \emph{hard} instances were not solved by any solver.
\end{itemize}.

STRUCTure was evaluated on 678 medium difficulty instances.
The time limit to solve a single instances was 15 minutes.  The time
limit in SAT Competitions is usually 20 minutes, but the rules
of DAS-4 cluster allow only 15 minutes jobs during the day time.
With extra 5 minutes STRUCTure can solve only few extra instances
so the additional time is not required to understand performance
an scalability.


With a timeout of 15 minutes, STRUCTure can solve about 170 problems
on a single DAS-4 node, but champions go to about 250.

\section{Parallel and Distributed Performance}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 1 machine, 1..8 threads
  \item 1..8 machines, 1 thread
  \item 1..8 machines, 8 threads
  \item Pick an instances and run it on up to 48 threads
\end{enumerate}
